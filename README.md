# Victoria's Work Sample

This project is a work sample following the instructions from Flexpa to integrate Flexpa Link and Flexpa API into a TypeScript web app

## To run this application

First, the client is run in a submodule. 
Once the project is cloned, you must run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update` to fetch all the data from the project.

### `npm start` and `npm run dev`

Once the submodule is fetched, you will need to run these commands in two separate terminals. This will run the application in dev mode\
Run `npm start` within the client folder and `npm run dev` in the server folder. The server is running on port 8000 and the client is running on 3000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
